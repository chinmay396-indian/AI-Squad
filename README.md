# AI Squad: A POC Powered by CrewAI Framework and Llama3

Welcome to the AI Squad repository! This project serves as a proof of concept (POC) to gain hands-on experience with the CrewAI framework and Llama3. AI Squad leverages advanced AI capabilities to automate and optimize software license management tasks, combining the expertise of intelligent agents in both development and quality assurance.

## Project Overview

AI Squad is designed to automate the process of sending reminder emails for software product license renewals. By integrating CrewAI and Llama3, this project demonstrates how intelligent agents can collaborate to deliver efficient and accurate automation solutions.

### Key Components

1. Developer Agent:
   - Technology: Llama3
   - Role: Expert Python coder with 15 years of experience.
   - Goal: Automate reminder emails for license renewals.
   - Capabilities: Writes high-quality, Pythonic code to manage and automate email communications with clients.

2. QA Agent:
   - Technology: Llama3
   - Role: Exceptional QA professional specializing in Python code.
   - Goal: Ensure the developed code is bug-free and production-ready.
   - Capabilities: Thoroughly tests the code, identifies bugs, and provides improvement suggestions.

### Collaborative Tasks

- Coding Task: The developer agent drafts and sends reminder emails to sales managers, detailing license renewal information with precision.
- QA Task: The QA agent rigorously tests the code, identifies bugs, and provides detailed suggestions for improvements.

## How It Works

1. Setup Agents: Define the roles, backstories, and goals for the developer and QA agents using Llama3.
2. Assign Tasks: Create and assign coding and QA tasks to the respective agents.
3. Iterative Process: Feed an example output into the AI Squad to enable iterative engineering and re-engineering of the code, ensuring optimal results.
4. Collaboration: Use the CrewAI framework to facilitate effective collaboration between agents, ensuring high-quality and accurate automation.

## Why AI Squad?

- Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, saving valuable time and resources.
- Accuracy: Ensures precision in communications and minimizes human error.
- Proactivity: Facilitates timely license renewals, enhancing customer satisfaction.
